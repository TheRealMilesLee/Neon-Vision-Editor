## Download

Prebuilt binaries are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases).

- Latest release: **v0.4.12**
- TestFlight beta: [Join here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/YWB2fGAP)
- Architecture: Apple Silicon (Intel not tested)
- Notarization: *is finally there*

## Getting Started (30 Seconds)

1. Install using `curl` or Homebrew (below), or download the latest `.zip`/`.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases).
2. Move `Neon Vision Editor.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Launch the app.
4. Open a file with `Cmd+O`.
5. Use `Cmd+P` for Quick Open and `Cmd+F` for Find & Replace.
6. Toggle Vim mode with `Cmd+Shift+V` if needed.

## Install

### Quick install (curl)

Install the latest release directly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Install without admin password prompts (user-local app folder):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --appdir "$HOME/Applications"
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap h3pdesign/tap
brew install --cask neon-vision-editor
```

Tap repository: [h3pdesign/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/h3pdesign/homebrew-tap)

If Homebrew asks for an admin password, it is usually because casks install into `/Applications`.
Use this to avoid that:

```bash
brew install --cask --appdir="$HOME/Applications" neon-vision-editor
```

### Gatekeeper (macOS 26 Tahoe)

If macOS blocks first launch:

1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**.
3. In **Security**, find the blocked app message.
4. Click **Open Anyway**.
5. Confirm the dialog.

## Features

- Fast loading for regular and large text files.
- Tabbed editing with per-file language support.
- Automatic syntax highlighting for many languages and formats.
- Optional support purchase flow (StoreKit 2) in Settings. **(NEW in v0.4.5)**
- Cross-platform theme settings panel with improved settings organization. **(NEW in v0.4.5)**
- Inline code completion with Tab-to-accept ghost suggestions.
- Starter templates for all languages with one-click insert.
- Document-type handling for `.plist`, `.sh`, and general text so Finder/iOS can route those files straight into the editor.
- Toolbar Map card in the welcome tour now scales to fill a taller inner frame, keeping the button cards inside the border.
- Regex Find/Replace with Replace All.
- Project tree sidebar plus Quick Open (`Cmd+P`).
- Optional Vim mode (basic normal/insert workflow).
- Multi-window workflow with focused-window commands.
- Native Swift/AppKit editor experience.
- No telemetry.

## Changelog

### v0.4.12 (summary)

- `scripts/release_all.sh` now accepts `notarized` as a positional alias, so `scripts/release_all.sh v0.4.12 notarized` works directly.
- Hosted notarized release workflow now enforces Xcode 17+ to preserve the Tahoe light/dark `AppIcon.icon` pipeline.
- Release asset verification now runs in strict iconstack mode to ensure published assets contain `AppIcon.iconstack`.
- Removed Xcode 16 fallback icon-copy path that could produce Sequoia/non-light-dark icon payloads in release assets.

### v0.4.11 (summary)

- ExpressionEngine language support in the editor language set.
- Plain text drag-and-drop support so dropped string content opens correctly in the editor.
- Release/docs metadata with TestFlight beta link surfaced in project documentation and download guidance.
- Release pipeline compatibility for hosted environments with Xcode 16 fallback handling.
- Notarized release publishing now hard-fails when icon payload validation fails, preventing bad assets from being published.

### v0.4.10 (summary)

- Release gate in `scripts/release_all.sh` now waits for a successful `Pre-release CI` run on the pushed commit before triggering notarization.
- Hosted notarized workflow now allows an explicit Xcode 16+ fallback path when Xcode 17 is unavailable on GitHub-hosted runners.
- Settings window responsiveness on macOS by deferring/caching editor font list loading.
- Reduced settings-open latency by removing forced full-window redraw calls during appearance application.

## Known Limitations

- Security policy and reporting details: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
