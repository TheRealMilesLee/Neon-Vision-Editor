## Download

Prebuilt binaries are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases).

- Latest release: **v0.4.18**
- TestFlight beta: [Join here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/YWB2fGAP)
- Architecture: Apple Silicon (Intel not tested)
- Notarization: *is finally there*

## Getting Started (30 Seconds)

1. Install using `curl` or Homebrew (below), or download the latest `.zip`/`.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases).
2. Move `Neon Vision Editor.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Launch the app.
4. Open a file with `Cmd+O`.
5. Use `Cmd+P` for Quick Open and `Cmd+F` for Find & Replace.
6. Toggle Vim mode with `Cmd+Shift+V` if needed.

## Install

### Quick install (curl)

Install the latest release directly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Install without admin password prompts (user-local app folder):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --appdir "$HOME/Applications"
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap h3pdesign/tap
brew install --cask neon-vision-editor
```

Tap repository: [h3pdesign/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/h3pdesign/homebrew-tap)

If Homebrew asks for an admin password, it is usually because casks install into `/Applications`.
Use this to avoid that:

```bash
brew install --cask --appdir="$HOME/Applications" neon-vision-editor
```

### Gatekeeper (macOS 26 Tahoe)

If macOS blocks first launch:

1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**.
3. In **Security**, find the blocked app message.
4. Click **Open Anyway**.
5. Confirm the dialog.

## Features

- Fast loading for regular and large text files.
- Tabbed editing with per-file language support.
- Automatic syntax highlighting for many languages and formats.
- Optional support purchase flow (StoreKit 2) in Settings. **(NEW in v0.4.5)**
- Cross-platform theme settings panel with improved settings organization. **(NEW in v0.4.5)**
- Inline code completion with Tab-to-accept ghost suggestions.
- Starter templates for all languages with one-click insert.
- Document-type handling for `.plist`, `.sh`, and general text so Finder/iOS can route those files straight into the editor.
- Toolbar Map card in the welcome tour now scales to fill a taller inner frame, keeping the button cards inside the border.
- Regex Find/Replace with Replace All.
- Project tree sidebar plus Quick Open (`Cmd+P`).
- Optional Vim mode (basic normal/insert workflow).
- Multi-window workflow with focused-window commands.
- Native Swift/AppKit editor experience.
- No telemetry.

## Changelog

### v0.4.18 (summary)

- Added iOS/macOS regression coverage in the editor refresh path so syntax highlighting remains stable across toolbar/menu and focus transitions.
- Improved editor rendering consistency by preventing view-update color assignments from overriding attributed syntax token colors.
- Fixed iOS issue where opening the toolbar `...` menu could temporarily drop syntax highlighting.
- Fixed macOS issue where moving focus away from the editor/window could temporarily drop syntax highlighting.

### v0.4.17 (summary)

- Added translucency-toggle highlight refresh wiring so editor recoloring is explicitly re-triggered when window translucency changes.
- Improved syntax-highlighting stability during appearance/translucency transitions by forcing an immediate refresh instead of waiting for unrelated edits.
- Fixed a macOS editor bug where toggling translucent window mode could temporarily hide syntax highlighting until another action (for example changing font size) forced a rehighlight.

### v0.4.16 (summary)

- Added a release-doc synchronization gate to `release_all.sh` via `prepare_release_docs.py --check` so releases fail fast when docs are stale.
- Added a delegate-based updater download service that reports live progress into the update dialog.
- Improved updater install flow to stay user-driven/manual after verification, with Finder handoff instead of in-place app replacement.
- Improved editor appearance switching so base text colors are enforced immediately on light/dark mode changes across macOS and iOS.
- Fixed light-mode editor base text color to consistently use dark text across themes.
