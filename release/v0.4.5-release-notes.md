## Neon Vision Editor v0.4.5

### Added
- Optional support purchase flow (StoreKit 2) with a dedicated **Settings -> Support** tab.
- Local StoreKit test configuration: `Neon Vision Editor/SupportOptional.storekit`.
- App Review notes for submission: `docs/AppStoreReviewNotes.md`.
- New cross-platform theme settings panel.
- iOS app icon asset catalog set.

### Improved
- Editor/settings architecture cleanup so editor options are centralized in the Settings dialog/sheet and aligned with toolbar actions.
- Language discovery and syntax-highlighting stability for newly opened tabs and during active editing.
- Sequoia/Tahoe compatibility guards and cross-platform settings presentation behavior.

### Fixed
- iOS Release build failure from missing `showSettingsSheet` state in `ContentView`.
- Find panel behavior (`Cmd+F`, initial focus, Enter-to-find-next) and highlight-current-line setting application.
- Line-number ruler overlap/flicker issues from line-fragment rendering logic.
- Editor text sanitization paths for paste/tab/open flows to reduce visible whitespace/control glyph injection.

### Validation
- macOS Release build: ✅
- iOS (generic device) Release build: ✅

### Known Issues
- `actool` reports a legacy iPad icon notice (`76x76@1x`) for iOS < 10 compatibility; this is non-blocking and does not fail builds.
- No additional release-blocking issues identified in the v0.4.5 audit.
